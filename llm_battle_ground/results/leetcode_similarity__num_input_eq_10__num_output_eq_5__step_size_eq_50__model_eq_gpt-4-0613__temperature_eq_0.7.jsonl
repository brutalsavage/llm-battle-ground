{"input_context": "Example 1: \nLeetCode Problem #2\nTitle: Add Two Numbers\nDescription:\nYou are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. \nExample 2: \nLeetCode Problem #3\nTitle: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\nDescription:\nGiven a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. \nExample 3: \nLeetCode Problem #4\nTitle: Median of Two Sorted Arrays\nDescription:\nGiven two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. \nExample 4: \nLeetCode Problem #5\nTitle: Longest Palindromic Substring\nDescription:\nGiven a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s. \nExample 5: \nLeetCode Problem #6\nTitle: Zigzag Conversion\nDescription:\nThe string \"PAYPALISHIRING\" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)...\n\nExample 6: \nLeetCode Problem #7\nTitle: Reverse Integer\nDescription:\nGiven a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then return 0. \nExample 7: \nLeetCode Problem #8\nTitle: String to Integer (atoi)\nDescription:\nImplement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function). \nExample 8: \nLeetCode Problem #9\nTitle: Palindrome Number\nDescription:\nGiven an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise. \nExample 9: \nLeetCode Problem #10\nTitle: Regular Expression Matching\nDescription:\nGiven an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for . and '*' where:...\n\nExample 10: \nLeetCode Problem #11\nTitle: Container With Most Water\nDescription:\nYou are given an integer array height of length n.
